## **1. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)**

### **What is it?**
The OSI model is a reference framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system in a network into seven distinct layers. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to facilitate interoperability between different network systems and manufacturers.

### **Number of layers**
The OSI model consists of **7 layers**.

### **Layer organization**

1. **Layer 1: Physical**
   - **Function:** Transmits bits over a physical medium (cables, fiber optics, radio waves).
   - **Example:** An Ethernet cable connecting a computer to a switch.

2. **Layer 2: Data Link**
   - **Function:** Provides error-free data transfer between two directly connected devices.
   - **Example:** MAC addresses that uniquely identify each device on a local network.

3. **Layer 3: Network**
   - **Function:** Determines how data is routed from the source to the destination across multiple networks.
   - **Example:** IP addresses and routers that direct traffic between different subnets.

4. **Layer 4: Transport**
   - **Function:** Manages end-to-end data transfer, ensuring integrity and order.
   - **Example:** TCP and UDP protocols that control how data is sent.

5. **Layer 5: Session**
   - **Function:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.
   - **Example:** Dialogue control between applications, like a chat session.

6. **Layer 6: Presentation**
   - **Function:** Translates data between the network format and the format understood by the application.
   - **Example:** Data encryption and compression, like SSL/TLS for secure connections.

7. **Layer 7: Application**
   - **Function:** Provides network services directly to user applications.
   - **Example:** HTTP protocols for web browsing, SMTP for email.

### **Practical Example of the OSI Model**

Imagine you are sending an email from your computer:

1. **Layer 7 (Application):** You use an email client (like Outlook) to draft the message.
2. **Layer 6 (Presentation):** The email is encrypted for security.
3. **Layer 5 (Session):** A session is established with the mail server.
4. **Layer 4 (Transport):** TCP ensures the email is sent correctly.
5. **Layer 3 (Network):** The IP address directs the email to the destination server.
6. **Layer 2 (Data Link):** The MAC address ensures the email reaches the correct device within the local network.
7. **Layer 1 (Physical):** Data is transmitted via Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.

## **3. MAC Address (Media Access Control)**

### **What is a MAC address**
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a deviceâ€™s network interface. It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model and is used for communication within a local network.

### **Format**
- Typically represented as six pairs of hexadecimal characters, e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.

### **Example:**
When you connect your computer to a Wi-Fi network, the router identifies your device by its MAC address to allow or deny access.

---

## **4. IP Address (Internet Protocol)**

### **What is an IP address**
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

### **Types of IP addresses**

#### **1. IPv4 Address**
- **Format:** 32 bits, represented in four octets separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **Example:** Your router's IP address might be `192.168.1.1`.

#### **2. IPv6 Address**
- **Format:** 128 bits, represented in eight groups of four hexadecimal characters separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **Example:** An IPv6 address might be `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a`.

### **Private and Public IP Addresses**

#### **Private Address**
- **Definition:** Addresses used within a private network that are not routable on the Internet.
- **Common ranges:**
  - `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
  - `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
  - `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
- **Example:** Your computer at home might have a private IP address like `192.168.1.100`.

#### **Public Address**
- **Definition:** Unique addresses across the entire Internet, assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP).
- **Example:** Your home's public IP address might be `203.0.113.45`.

### **Localhost**
- **Definition:** A special IP address that refers to the local computer.
- **Address:** `127.0.0.1` in IPv4 and `::1` in IPv6.
- **Example:** If you run a local web server on your computer, you can access it by browsing to `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`.

### **Subnet**
- **Definition:** A logical subdivision of a larger IP network.
- **Example:** In a corporate network with the IP address `192.168.1.0/24`, subnets can be created like `192.168.1.0/26`, `192.168.1.64/26`, etc., to segment different departments.

### **Why IPv6 was created**
Due to the depletion of IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was developed to provide a much larger address space and to solve scalability and security issues.
